### Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

Just your ordinary Cybersecurity student from Luxembourg.
Low maintenance, runs mostly on caffeine and pineapple-free pizza.
My main interests are computer networking, automating infrastructure deployment and home automation.

I am a big advocate of automating things with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) whenever possible, both for private and professional use.
Check out [Ansiblization](https://github.com/ansiblization), the organization I have created to publish the Ansible roles I am writing for my home network.
