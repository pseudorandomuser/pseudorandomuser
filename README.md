### Welcome to my GitHub profile 👋

Just your ordinary Cybersecurity student from Luxembourg 🇱🇺<br>
Low maintenance, will run mostly on caffeine and pineapple-free pizza ☕️<br>
My main interests consist of computer networking, automating infrastructure deployment and home automation 💻

I am a staunch advocate for automating server deployment and configuration using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) whenever possible, both for private and professional use.<br>
Check out [Ansiblization](https://github.com/ansiblization), the organization I have created to publish the Ansible roles I am writing for my home network.
